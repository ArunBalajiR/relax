# Relax (Noisli Clone)

[![Made with Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Flutter-%2345D1FE)](https://flutter.dev/)

## Focus ! Relax ! Sleep !

Try Relax for better Productivity.

Ease of choosing and blending the ambient sounds into a mixture that will perfectly fit your mood.

The purpose of this application is to be a study aid, allowing people to focus more effectively with the aid of ambience sound. This program is a clone of noisli developed for my personal offline use, however feel free to use it.
